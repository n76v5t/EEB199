Plagiarism detection: “Normally, students will   be   required to submit their course essays to the   University’s   plagiarism detection tool for a   review of textual   similarity   and   detection of   possible   plagiarism.   In doing so, students will   allow their   essays to   be   included as source documents   in the tool’s   reference   database, where they   will   be   used   solely for the   purpose of    detecting   plagiarism. The terms that   apply   to   the   University's         use of this tool are described on the   Centre   for Teaching   Support    Innovation website (https://teaching.utoronto.ca/ed-tech/teaching-technology/pdt/pdt-faq/)".
